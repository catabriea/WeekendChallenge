# WeekendChallenge

I tried to go hard mode and create a random EMployee function...however, I just couldn't get it to fire properly.

I orignally had a alot more styling on my CSS but for some reason it was overriding my employeechart and I couldn't see populated results.

I hope this is sufficient. I spent about 6+ hours doing this...It was very challenging, but I did remember quite a bit from this week's lessons.
